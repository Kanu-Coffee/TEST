# Repository Agent Instructions

- Always perform development work on the `codex-dev` branch unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Prefer reusing the `codex-dev` branch for new commits and pull requests instead of creating additional feature branches.
- Follow standard repository contribution guidelines and keep automation workflows intact.
